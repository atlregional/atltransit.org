CCT provides local bus service within Cobb County and commuter bus to and from Downtown and Midtown Atlanta.  

Services operate Monday through Saturday.  Breeze Cards can be used by passengers to transfer between the MARTA system.  Breeze Cards can be used for non-transfer trips as well, if they are loaded with stored cash value or a CCT fare product.  

ADA complementary paratransit services are also available for qualified riders.
