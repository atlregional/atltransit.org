GRTA Xpress service is a commuter bus service that provides trips to and from 12 counties in the Atlanta region into Downtown and Midtown Atlanta and other regional employment centers.  

It operates Monday through Friday, primarily during the morning and afternoon/evening commute times.  All of the routes connect to MARTA rail stations. 

There are various Xpress passes available for passengers in two different fare zones.  Passengers may also use a Breeze Card to pay Xpress fare if it is loaded with stored cash value and to make free transfers between the MARTA system.
