    <strong>Question: </strong>Can I get a free transfer between CCT and GCT buses?</p>
<p>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>No, in order to transfer between any of the suburban/express operators (GCT, CCT, GRTA Xpress), you must ride MARTA between the two suburban/express transit services.</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question: </strong>How long is my free transfer valid?</p>
<p>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>Free transfers between transit operators are valid for varying lengths of time. Here's a quick look at how long transfers are valid:
    <ul>
        <li>Transfer from MARTA: 3 hours</li>
        <li>Transfer from GCT: 1.5 hours</li>
        <li>Transfer from CCT: 3 hours</li>
        <li>Transfer from GRTA: 3 hours</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question: </strong>Why are transit fares so complicated?</p>
<p>
    <strong>Answer: </strong>Unfortunately, figuring out which fare to buy and where it will get you can be challenging when you cross jurisdictional boundaries. The region's transit operators are working together to make this process simpler. But, in the meantime, be sure to take advantage of free transfers between MARTA and the other operators with the Breeze Card.
