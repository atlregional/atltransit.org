**Question:** Why are transit fares so complicated?

**Answer:** Unfortunately, figuring out which fare to buy and where it will get you can be challenging when you cross jurisdictional boundaries. The region's transit operators are working together to make this process simpler. But, in the meantime, be sure to take advantage of free transfers between MARTA and the other operators with the Breeze Card. [More info &raquo;](/fares/products)
