## The basics

### Trips involving one transit agency (e.g. MARTA)

* Transfers between buses of the same operator are **free** (except for GRTA Xpress).
* Bus to rail (and vice versa) transfers are always free (according to transfer rules).

### Trips involving more than one transit agency (e.g. MARTA + CCT)

* You **must** use a Breeze Card to receive a free transfer.
* MARTA **must** begin or end your journey. (No transfers between suburban operators.)
* Your Breeze Card **must** have an operator-specific fare product or stored cash value to begin a regional trip.

## How transfers work

1. Board a bus or train with your Breeze Card.
2. Arrive at your point of transfer (see major transfer stations below).
3. Using the same Breeze Card, board the next vehicle on your trip.

**Note:** If you do not have a Breeze Card, you will have to pay the full-priced fare for each bus or train you board.


## Transfer rules
{:.row-heading}

Each agency has its own specific rules about transfers, but here are some general rules of thumb.

## Transfer restrictions

It's a little confusing, but there are some restrictions about when you can collect a free transfer, depending on which transit agencies your trip involves.

### <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Does your journey involve MARTA?
* If so, you may transfer for free to (or from) any suburban/express operator.
* Suburban operators include GCT, CCT, and GRTA Xpress. 

### <i class="fa fa-times"></i> Does your journey involve two different suburban services?
* Sorry, direct free transfers between suburban/express transit agencies are currently **not allowed**. 
* You must travel on MARTA directly before or after one of the suburban/express transit agencies in order to collect a free transfer.
