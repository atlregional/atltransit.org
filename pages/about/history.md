### Pilot project

ATLtransit is a joint project of the major transit agencies in metro Atlanta, who are working together to provide a unified resource for transit customers in the region.

### Regional information hub

Looking for transit information?  You've come to the right place.  The transit agencies in the Atlanta region have collected all of the information about their service here.  

Whether you're looking for [real-time data](/tools/realtime/), [trip planning](/plan), or simply information on [how to pay your fare](/fares/products/), you can find it on atltransit.org.

## Multiple agencies working in partnership

MARTA, CobbLinc, Gwinnett County Transit, and Xpress provide the Atlanta region with a coordinated network of transit options.

## History of ATLtransit

State Senator Brandon Beach originally devised a regional transit information portal after encountering difficulties when travelling between transit agencies.

He documented his journey from <a href="/plan/#fromPlace=34.03469763500044%2C-84.58262787899969&fromName=Kennesaw+State+University%2C+1000+Chastain+Rd+NW+Kennesaw%2C+GA+30144&toPlace=33.99136160395591%2C-84.0904314499507&toName=6400+Sugarloaf+Pkwy%2C+Duluth%2C+Georgia%2C+30097%2C+USA&mode=TRANSIT%2CWALK&time=04%3A30+pm&date=2015-10-15&arriveBy=false">Kennesaw State University to the Infinite Energy Center (Gwinnett Arena)</a> in the YouTube video below:
