### Pilot project

ATLtransit is a joint pilot project of the major transit agencies in metro Atlanta, who are working together to provide a unified resource for transit customers in the region.

### Regional information hub

Looking for transit information?  You've come to the right place.  The transit agencies in the Atlanta region have collected all of the information about their service here.  

Whether you're looking for [real-time data](/tools/realtime/), [trip planning](/plan), or simply information on [how to pay your fare](/fares/products/), you can find it on atltransit.org.

## Multiple agencies working in partnership

Anchored by MARTA and served by three additional transit providers, the Atlanta region offers citizens and visitors a coordinated network of transit options.

While it may seem like transit in Atlanta is fragmented, there are great coordination efforts going on to make public transit more efficient and easier to use.  [Learn more about efforts to build better regional transit Â»](/about/regional-transit)
