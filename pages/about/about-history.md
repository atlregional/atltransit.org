## Stitching transit together

ATLtransit is a joint pilot project of the major transit agencies in metro Atlanta, who are working together to provide a unified resource for transit customers in the region.

### Multiple agencies working in partnership

While it may seem like transit in Atlanta is fragmented, there are great coordination efforts going on to make public transit more efficient and easier to use.  Check out [About regional transit](/regional-transit) for more on these efforts.

## History of atltransit.org

[atltransit.org](/) was originally devised of by State Senator Brandon Beach, who encountered difficulties when travelling between transit agencies.
