The Regional Transit Committee (RTC) is a policy committee of the Atlanta Regional Commission that focuses on issues of regional transit planning, funding and governance. 

The RTC builds upon the work of its predecessors, the Transit Implementation Board (TIB) and the Transit Planning Board (TPB).  [Learn more about the RTC »](http://atlantaregional.com/about-us/board--committees/regional-transit-committee)

Concept 3 is the Atlanta region's official long-range transit vision. It was developed through a collaborative, multi-year effort led by the Transit Planning Board, a predecessor to today's (RTC). 

The vision was officially adopted in 2008 and now serves as the transit element of the Aspirations Plan of the Regional Transportation Plan.

Currently travelling with multiple transit agencies requires having either multiple fare products (e.g., GRTA fare and MARTA fare) or cash stored on your Breeze Card.  There is no option for a regional "all-access" pass.

In addition to work to support the Breeze fare payment system, the transit agencies are working towards a regional fare product, so that customers could purchase a single monthly pass and travel anywhere in the region.
