## Fares

Boarding a bus or train in Atlanta is as simple as tapping your Breeze Card.

The Breeze Card is the *only way* to access a free transfer between MARTA and a Breeze partner transit agency (Cobb, Gwinnett and GRTA).  Free transfers are not valid between the partner transit agencies (e.g. Gwinnett to GRTA or Cobb to Gwinnett).
