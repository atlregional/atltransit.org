## Fares

Boarding a bus or train in Atlanta is as simple as tapping your Breeze Card.

The Breeze Card is the *only way* to access a free transfer between MARTA and a Breeze partner transit agency (CobbLinc, Gwinnett County Transit and XPress).  Free transfers are not available between any of the following transit agencies: CobbLinc, GCT or XPress.
