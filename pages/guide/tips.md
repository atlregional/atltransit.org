## Top 6 Transit Tips for New Riders

1.  No one likes guessing when the bus or train will arrive.  Check the schedule online, or **download the OneBusAway App** to look up real-time and scheduled arrivals.

2.  **Arrive a few minutes early** to your stop or station.

3.  If you're waiting for a bus, **stand near the stop's signage and give eye contact to the driver** as they approach.

4.  Paying in cash or coins can delay the bus.  Help make the trip faster for everyone and **pre-load cash fare onto a Breeze Card.**

5.  **Transit staff are your friends and can help answer your questions.**  Let a bus driver know if you're unfamiliar with where to get off, or ask a rail station agent if you're unfamiliar with the system.

6.  **Take advatnage of your new found productivity time on transit:** bring a book, listen to a podcast, or catch-up on emails.
