## Top 6 Tips for New Transit Riders

1.  No one likes guessing when the bus or train will arrive.  Check the schedule online, or <a href="http://atltransit.org/guide/safety/#real-time-info"> **download the OneBusAway App** </a> to look up real-time and scheduled arrivals.

2.  **Arrive a few minutes early** to your stop or station.

3.  When waiting for the bus, **stand near the bus stop signage and signal** as the vehicle approaches.

4.  Paying in cash or coins can delay the bus.  Help make the trip faster for everyone and <a href="http://www.breezecard.com/"> **pre-load cash fare onto a Breeze Card.** </a>

5.  **Transit staff are your friends and can help answer your questions.**  Let a bus driver know if you're unfamiliar with where to get off, or ask a rail station agent if you're unfamiliar with the system.

6.  **Take advantage of your new found productivity time on transit:** bring a book, listen to a podcast, or catch-up on emails.
